I am currently a Research Fellow in the [Department of Information Systems, Business Statistics and Operations Management ](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk)(ISOM) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, working with [Prof. Guodong Lyu](https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/imlyu).

I received my Ph.D. from the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ), where I was advised by [Prof. Haoxiang Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/haoxiangyang). Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. in Mathematics from the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).

My research interests include **multistage stochastic mixed-integer programming, contextual optimization, and applications in power systems**.
